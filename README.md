# Memory Game

## What is the Memory Game
This is a memory game that I built as part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## Challenge
Find pairs of matching cards with as litte moves and in as little time as possible.

## How to Play
* Click to flip over the cards.
* If the two cards are a match, they will be kept open.
* If the two cards are not a match, they will be returned to their face-down positions. Remember where the cards are, so that you can come back to them again after finding their matching cards.
* You complete the game after all the cards have been matched.
