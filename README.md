# Memory Game

## What is the Memory Game
This is a memory game that I built as part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree

## Challenge
Find pairs of matching cards, in less time and with less moves.

## How to Play
* Click on two cards at a time
* If the two cards are a match, they will be kept open
* If the two cards are not a match, they will be closed. Remember the cards so that you can find .
* You complete the game after all the cards are matched
